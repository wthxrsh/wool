- **X-Content-Type-Options**
- **X-Frame-Options**
- **X-XSS-Protection**
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
- **Referrer Policy**
- **Permissions Policy**

### üîê SSL/TLS Security

- HTTPS enforcement
- Certificate information analysis

### üìä Comprehensive Reporting
- Color-coded output with severity levels
- Detailed vulnerability descriptions
- Security recommendations
- JSON export functionality

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd web-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Verify installation**
   ```bash
   node scanner.js --help
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Scan a single website
node scanner.js https://example.com

# Scan with custom options
node scanner.js https://example.com --verbose --output results.json
```

### Command Line Options
```bash
Options:
  -o, --output <file>    Output file for results
  -v, --verbose          Verbose output
  -h, --help            Display help information
  -V, --version         Display version information
```

### Examples

#### Scan a website for vulnerabilities
```bash
node scanner.js https://example.com
```

#### Save results to a file
```bash
node scanner.js https://example.com --output scan_results.json
```

#### Verbose scanning
```bash
node scanner.js https://example.com --verbose
```

## Output Format

The scanner provides detailed output with the following structure:

### Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL** - Immediate security risks
- **HIGH** - Significant security vulnerabilities
- **MEDIUM** - Moderate security issues
- **LOW** - Minor security concerns
- **INFO** - Informational findings

### Output Categories
- **Vulnerabilities** - Actual security issues found
- **Warnings** - Potential issues or configuration problems
- **Information** - General findings and recommendations

### JSON Export
Results are automatically saved to a JSON file with the following structure:
```json
{
  "target": "https://example.com",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "vulnerabilities": [...],
  "warnings": [...],
  "info": [...]
}
```
